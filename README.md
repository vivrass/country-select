# Country-Select

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries.  The list of countries comes from the ISO 3166 standard.  While it is a relatively neutral source of country names, it may still offend some users.

Users are strongly advised to evaluate the suitability of this list given their user base.

## Latest Changes

**1.1.1**

- Fixed incompatibility with Rails 3.2.2 (thanks to [jmazzi](https://github.com/jamesds/country-select/pull/4))

**1.1.0**

- Updated the country list to change the name of *Libyan Arab Jamahiriya* to *Libya* according to the [latest ISO 3166 newsletter](http://www.iso.org/iso/nl_vi-11_name_change_for_libya.pdf)
- A country in the priority list will be selected there and not in the main list (thanks to [yyyc514](https://github.com/jamesds/country-select/pull/3))
- Removed relics from the pre-gem days

## Installation

Install as a gem using

    gem install country-select
